## Project Overview
Welcome to the "Video Claim Classification" project repository at TikTok. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy to users. In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With this model, we can efficiently prioritize and review user reports, reducing the backlog and enhancing user experience.
